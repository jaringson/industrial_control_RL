# Industrial Control RL

This project is a beginning to my effort to better understand Reinforcment Learning. I desided to create an environment that simulates a cooling process of a data center where there is a process to cool each data server. 
I created a series of control variables that determine the mass flow of cooling liquid between each zone. This allows the system to maintain the temperature while also hopefully expending the least about of power.
Here is the link for a better explanation of the custom [environment](industrial_env/README.md).
